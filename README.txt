Recipe Finder - Fullstack (ZIP)
-------------------------------

What's included:
- frontend/index.html  --> Open directly in browser for preview
- backend/server.js    --> Simple Express server (demo favorites in-memory)

How to run locally (backend):
1. cd backend
2. npm install
3. node server.js   # or `npm run dev` if you install nodemon for convenience
By default backend runs on port 4000.

Frontend preview:
- Open frontend/index.html in your browser (double click) to preview without setup.

Notes:
- This ZIP includes a lightweight demo backend (no DB/auth) so you can run a local server quickly.
- If you want full MongoDB + JWT auth wired, tell me and I will add the models/routes and update the server accordingly.
